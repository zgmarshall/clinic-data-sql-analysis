# Clinic Data SQL Analysis

This is a personal data analytics project where I designed and explored a relational database simulating a clinic environment. It focuses on developing my SQL skills using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin, and it represents an early step in my transition into a healthcare data analyst role.

## 📊 Project Overview

The project uses synthetic anonymized healthcare data structured into multiple related tables, including:
- `patients`
- `appointments`
- `billing`
- `clinic_resources`

I used Microsoft Excel to clean the data, and SQL to explore and analyze the data in PostgreSQL.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build and manage a normalized relational database
- Practice importing real-world-style CSVs into PostgreSQL
- Write SQL queries to generate clinic-level insights
- Simulate reporting tasks a healthcare data analyst would perform

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Excel (for cleaning and prep)
- PostgreSQL (via pgAdmin 4)
- SQL (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, aggregate functions, data type casting)

## 🔍 Sample Analysis Questions

- What is the total revenue by clinic?
- How does insurance coverage affect out-of-pocket expenses?
- What patterns emerge in patient visit frequency?
- Which appointment types generate the highest average billing?

## 📁 File Structure

- `sql/analysis_queries.sql` – Core SQL queries used for analysis
- `outputs/insights_summary.md` – Key findings and observations
- `data/` – Description of dataset structure (real data not included for privacy)

## 📌 What I Learned

- How to manage multiple related tables in PostgreSQL
- Common issues in data import (e.g., data type mismatches, spelling errors)
- SQL casting and column updates
- Building reusable SQL scripts and documenting work clearly

## 🔗 About Me

I'm studying data analytics with a goal of transitioning from patient service coordination into a data analyst role with a focus on healthcare. This project showcases some of my technical growth and commitment to that goal.
